# Frontend Mentor - Four Card Feature Section

üì¶ Overview

This project is a responsive four-card feature section built using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox/Grid layout techniques. The layout is designed to display four distinct cards, each representing a different feature with a title, description, and icon. The project is styled based on the design provided by Frontend Mentor and includes hover effects and media queries for responsive design.

‚úÖ My Process

File Structure and Organization:

- Organized the project using separate CSS files for base styles, default styles, and specific       components (header, product cards, media queries).
- Implemented the BEM methodology for class naming to maintain clarity and modularity.

HTML Structure:

- Used semantic HTML elements like `<header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <div>` for structure and accessibility.
- Implemented a grid layout for the product cards to control alignment and spacing.

CSS Styling:

- Defined CSS variables for colors, font sizes, spacing, and other design tokens to maintain consistency.
- Applied Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout structuring.
- Added hover states for interactive feedback on cards.
- Ensured responsive design using media queries to adjust layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
